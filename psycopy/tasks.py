The field of Human–Robot Collaboration (HRC) is tasked with designing proactive and autonomous robot collaborators able to complement the superior capabilities of human workers to maximize throughput, improve safety of the workplace, and reduce cognitive load on humans. The general application domain for HRC is composed of a robot that collaborates with humans on a joint task such as furniture  assembly, assembly lines, or other factory-related applications. However, state of the art technologies still rely on sterile and rigid interactions that resort to turn-taking behaviors, tele-operation, or more generally limited autonomy and decision making capabilities. 

Conversely, human–human interaction (HHI) during teamwork does not show this friction. Fluent and natural HHIs are multimodal, highly contextual and situated. This is particularly true when coordination during teamwork is at tended through natural language. Humans resolve the natural ambiguities of speech by integrating verbal with non-verbal cues and, importantly, by grounding speech to the physical domain of the interaction—e.g. through implicature or lexical entrainment. 

Yet, despite evidence of the importance of situated natural language in HHI, achieving the same level of richness still represents a significant challenge for HRI in general and HRC in particular. Reasons for this are specific to HRC, e.g. the presence of noise in environments such as those commonly found in factories. Noisy environments may result in failure to recognize significant portions of an utterance—if not the totality of it. This not only leads to erroneous naming of specific actions and objects, but also makes the structure of sentences harder to parse by natural language understanding (NLU) algorithms that exploit syntax. Most notably, impediments to deploying effective HRC interactions are also to be found in the very nature of the communication itself. Communication during collaboration often occurs in a time constrained context, is highly goal-oriented, typically requires a high success rate in order to be effective, is domain-dependent, and often features mutual adaptation between peers. The time constraint during collaboration pressures agents to make shorter utterances that might not be well-formed sentences; the noise and the need for unambiguity favor some classes of words over others, often resulting in a highly domain-specific language. All these factors greatly hamper the deployment of standard NLU techniques to HRC. State-of-the-art technologies resort extensively to hand-coded domain knowledge, or require training on large datasets most of which are taken from descriptive text and are borrowed from different contexts that do not necessarily leverage the specific domain knowledge. Still, to achieve the level of fluency seen in HHIs, a core ability of future generations of robots will be for them to collaborate with humans through the situated interactions with which humans are most comfortable.

In an effort to minimize injury and let carpenters focus on design and other bigger-picture tasks, a team from MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) has created AutoSaw, a system that lets you customize different items that can then be constructed with the help of robots.

Users can choose from a range of carpenter-designed templates for chairs, desks and other furniture -- and eventually could use AutoSaw for projects as large as a deck or a porch.

"If you're building a deck, you have to cut large sections of lumber to length, and that's often done on site," says CSAIL postdoc Jeffrey Lipton, who was a lead author on a related paper about the system. "Every time you put a hand near a blade, you're at risk. To avoid that, we've largely automated the process using a chop-saw and jigsaw."

The system also gives general users more flexibility in designing furniture to be able to fit space-constrained houses and apartments. For example, it could allow you to modify a desk to squeeze into an L-shaped living room, or customize a table to fit in your micro-kitchen.

"Robots have already enabled mass production, but with artificial intelligence (AI) they have the potential to enable mass customization and personalization in almost everything we produce," says CSAIL director and co-author Daniela Rus. "AutoSaw shows this potential for easy access and customization in carpentry."

The paper, which will be presented in May at the International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) in Brisbane, Australia, was co-written by Lipton, Rus and PhD student Adriana Schulz. Other co-authors include MIT professor Wojciech Matusik, PhD student Andrew Spielberg and undergraduate Luis Trueba.
