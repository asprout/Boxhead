Task Descriptions (please let me know if the instructions aren't clear enough in the actual application)

1) Paired association
	First they will be presented with each pair for 0.5 seconds. (This time could be adjusted, it's just that shorter times seemed really hard to have any kind of correct answers)
	Then, they will be tested to see if they can recognize which pairs are correct. In this part, they should press the "up" arrow if they think the answer is correct, else they should press the "down" arrow

2) Word association
	They will be given a word, and they should write verbs related to the word for 60 seconds. After each word they think of they should hit the "enter" key. Repeat 5 times. Maybe want to reduce the number of trials for this. 

3) Reading comprehension
	They will first be asked to read articles. They are given time limits for each page, but can click any key to move on the next page. They cannot move back pages.
	After reading, they will be asked a couple questions about each article. They can use the appropriate letter key to record their response.
